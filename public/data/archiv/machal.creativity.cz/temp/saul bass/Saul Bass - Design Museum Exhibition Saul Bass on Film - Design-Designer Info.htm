        <TR>
          <TD class=maintxt width=315><B>SAUL BASS (1920-1996) was not only 
            one of the great graphic designers of the mid-20th century but the 
            undisputed master of film title design thanks to his collaborations 
            with Alfred Hitchcock, Otto Preminger and Martin Scorsese.</B> 
            <BR><BR>When the reels of film for Otto Preminger’s controversial 
            new drugs movie, The Man with the Golden Arm, arrived at US movie 
            theatres in 1956, a note was stuck on the cans - "Projectionists – 
            pull curtain before titles". <BR><BR>Until then, the lists of cast 
            and crew members which passed for movie titles were so dull that 
            projectionists only pulled back the curtains to reveal the screen 
            once they’d finished. But Preminger wanted his audience to see The 
            Man with the Golden Arm’s titles as an integral part of the film. 
            <BR><BR>The movie’s theme was the struggle of its hero - a jazz 
            musician played by Frank Sinatra - to overcome his heroin addiction. 
            Designed by the graphic designer Saul Bass the titles featured an 
            animated black paper-cut-out of a heroin addict’s arm. Knowing that 
            the arm was a powerful image of addiction, Bass had chosen it – 
            rather than Frank Sinatra’s famous face - as the symbol of both the 
            movie’s titles and its promotional poster. <BR><BR>That cut-out arm 
            caused a sensation and Saul Bass reinvented the movie title as an 
            art form. By the end of his life, he had created over 50 title 
            sequences for Preminger, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, John 
            Frankenheimer and Martin Scorsese. Although he later claimed that he 
            found the Man with the Golden Arm sequence "a little disappointing 
            now, because it was so imitated". <BR><BR>Even before he made his 
            cinematic debut, Bass was a celebrated graphic designer. Born in the 
            Bronx district of New York in 1920 to an emigré furrier and his 
            wife, he was a creative child who drew constantly. Bass studied at 
            the Art Students League in New York and Brooklyn College under 
            Gyorgy Kepes, an Hungarian graphic designer who had worked with 
            László Moholy-Nagy in 1930s Berlin and fled with him to the US. 
            Kepes introduced Bass to Moholy’s Bauhaus style and to Russian 
            Constructivism. <BR><BR>After apprenticeships with Manhattan design 
            firms, Bass worked as a freelance graphic designer or "commercial 
            artist" as they were called. Chafing at the creative constraints 
            imposed on him in New York, he moved to Los Angeles in 1946. After 
            freelancing, he opened his own studio in 1950 working mostly in 
            advertising until Preminger invited him to design the poster for his 
            1954 movie, Carmen Jones. Impressed by the result, Preminger asked 
            Bass to create the film’s title sequence too. <BR><BR>Now 
            over-shadowed by Bass’ later work, Carmen Jones elicited commissions 
            for titles for two 1955 movies: Robert Aldrich’s The Big Knife, and 
            Billy Wilder’s The Seven Year Itch. But it was his next Preminger 
            project, The Man with the Golden Arm, which established Bass as the 
            doyen of film title design. <BR><BR>Over the next decade he honed 
            his skill by creating an animated mini-movie for Mike Todd’s 1956 
            Around The World In 80 Days and a tearful eye for Preminger’s 1958 
            Bonjour Tristesse. Blessed with the gift of identifying the one 
            image which symbolised the movie, Bass then recreated it in a 
            strikingly modern style. Martin Scorsese once described his approach 
            as creating: "an emblematic image, instantly recognisable and 
            immediately tied to the film". <BR><BR>In 1958’s Vertigo, his first 
            title sequence for Alfred Hitchcock, Bass shot an extreme close-up 
            of a woman’s face and then her eye before spinning it into a 
            sinister spiral as a bloody red soaks the screen. For his next 
            Hitchcock commission, 1959’s North by Northwest, the credits swoop 
            up and down a grid of vertical and diagonal lines like passengers 
            stepping off elevators. It is only a few minutes after the movie has 
            begun - with Cary Grant stepping out of an elevator - that we 
            realise the grid is actually the façade of a skyscraper. 
            <BR><BR>Equally haunting are the vertical bars sweeping across the 
            screen in a manic, mirrored helter-skelter motif at the beginning of 
            Hitchcock’s 1960 Psycho. This staccato sequence is an inspired 
            symbol of Norman Bates’ fractured psyche. Hitchcock also allowed 
            Bass to work on the film itself, notably on its dramatic highpoint, 
            the famous shower scene with Janet Leigh. <BR><BR>Assisted by his 
            second wife, Elaine, Bass created brilliant titles for other 
            directors - from the animated alley cat in 1961’s Walk on the Wild 
            Side, to the adrenalin-laced motor racing sequence in 1966’s Grand 
            Prix – but became increasingly frustrated at being relegated to a 
            minor role. He directed a series of shorts culminating in 1968’s 
            Oscar-winning Why Man Creates and finally realised his ambition to 
            direct a feature with 1974’s Phase IV. <BR><BR>When Phase IV 
            flopped, Bass returned to commercial graphic design. His corporate 
            work included devising highly successful corporate identities for 
            United Airlines, AT&amp;T, Minolta, Bell Telephone System and Warner 
            Communications. He also designed the poster for the 1984 Los Angeles 
            Olymic Games. <BR><BR>To younger film directors, Saul Bass was a 
            cinema legend with whom they longed to work. In 1987, he was 
            persuaded to create the titles for James Brooks’ Broadcast News and 
            then for Penny Marshall’s 1988 Big. In 1990, Bass found a new long 
            term collaborator in Martin Scorsese who had grown up with – and 
            idolised - his 1950s and 1960s titles. After 1990’s Goodfellas and 
            1991’s Cape Fear, Bass created a sequence of blossoming rose petals 
            for Scorcese’s 1993’s The Age of Innocence and a hauntingly macabre 
            one of Robert De Niro falling through the sinister neons of the Las 
            Vegas Strip for the director’s 1995’s Casino to symbolise his 
            character’s descent into hell. <BR><BR>Saul Bass died the next year. 
            His New York Times obituary hailed him as "the minimalist auteur who 
            put a jagged arm in motion in 1955 and created an entire film 
            genre…and elevated it into an art." <BR><BR>© Design Museum 
            <BR><BR><BR><B>Biography</B> <BR><BR>1920 Saul Bass is born in the 
            Bronx district of New York. <BR><BR>1944 After studying at the Art 
            Students League, Bass enrols at Brooklyn College. His teacher is the 
            emigré Hungarian graphic designer, Gyorgy Kepes, who had taught at 
            László Moholy-Nagy’s New Bauhaus, Chicago. <BR><BR>1945 Graduates

            Carmen Jones. Bass shoots an elaborately lit dripping tap and 
            distorts the speed to invert the image for the title sequence. 
            <BR><BR>1955 Designs titles for Robert Aldrich’s The Big Knife and 
            Billy Wilder’s The Seven Year Itch. For the latter, the letter ‘I’ 
            scratches itchily on to the screen. Preminger’s The Man with the 
            Golden Arm opens and Bass’s ground-breaking titles – an animated 
            sequence of an heroin addict’s arm – create a furore. <BR><BR>1957
