      <P class=aruti>Otto Preminger's film about Israel</P>
      <P class=aut>by Ronny Loewy</P>
      <P class=artx>The deportation of 4500 displaced persons, who arrived in 
      Palestine on the "Exodus 47" and were then sent back via France by the 
      British, finally to arrive in the Pöppendorf internment camp in Lübeck, 
      Germany, in September 1947, was a media event which the Aliyah Beth people 
      helped organize, even if not of their own choosing. It was up to Aliyah 
      Beth officials to stop the organized transport of refugees at Port de Boue 
      in southern France and thus to prevent their further transportation to 
      Germany. The Aliyah Beth activists, Zionists as well as Revisionists, 
      created a successful enough refugee drama out of the situation to ralley 
      international pressure, particularly against British Mandate rule, and to 
      speed up the decision-making process in favor of founding a Jewish state. 
      The images of British war-ships and of forlorn children, women and men, 
      forced to leave Haifa after having just arrived, created ripples 
      throughout the world and significantly enriched the iconographic arsenal 
      of the Exodus metaphor.</P>
      <P class=artx>The 1960 <A 
      href="http://www.cine-holocaust.de/cgi-bin/gdq?efw00fbw000130.gd">Exodus</A> 
      film deals with this metaphor, which seeks to provide a pre-modern 
      explanation for a modern community of Jews. When Exodus reached the 
      cinemas, many film critics referred to it as "Birth of a Nation". They 
      were in fact sharing a misunderstanding (the birth of state does indeed 
      come at the end of the film) with the director Otto Preminger, as well as 
      with Leon Uris, the author of the book on which the film was based.</P>
      <P class=artx>One of the Zionist leadership's reinterpretations - dating 
      from 1945 at the very latest - of the Zionist movement's establishment, 
      but of a homeland in Eretz Israel as a collective movement of the Jewish 
      people, not of an Israeli nation, served the Exodus metaphor as a meeting 
      point of history and the present. The terrific impact of Holocaust 
      survivors, gathered together by Aliyah Beth in an extremely 
      well-organized, daring and highly risky ship's passage to Palestine, was 
      used to heighten the dramaturgy of an act of foundation.</P>
      <P class=artx>From the Zionist standpoint, the complex identity debate 
      surrounding interpretations of the Jewish state - a community based on a 
      common faith versus people, faith versus nation - was to have superimposed 
      upon it the powerful image of the "birth of a Jewish nation" as an act 
      which liberated the Diaspora through settlement of the land by "Jewish 
      Israelis" in "Eretz Israel". The powerful image is all important, since it 
      enabled the "Jewish Israelis" to achieve their goals through a politically 
      and militarily radical liberation movement - goals which ranged from 
      forcing the British to exercise their duty as the mandatory power in 
      Palestine, to triumphing over their Arab competitors for land possession, 
      and even to restraining religious opponents within their own camp.</P>
      <P class=artx>The film Exodus gives an account of the secular triumph of 
      Zionism. The second half of the film deals with the diverse conflicts 
      within Palestine at the time of the founding of the State of Israel. The 
      myths the film reveals are those that pertained at the time of the state's 
      foundation: "the birth of the Jewish state" as a conscious act of "the 
      saved", of those who survived the destruction of European Jewry, the focus 
      of the first half of the film. Exodus takes place between the middle of 
      September and the end of November 1947. The decision of the Haganah to 
      concentrate all its efforts on getting the displaced persons held by the 
      British in a Cyprus detention camp onto a ship to Palestine, was lent 
      additional weight when news filtered through that 4500 Jews had been put 
      back on ships the previous week and transported to a camp near Hamburg, 
      even after they had gone ashore in Palestine. This is in fact the only 
      direct reference to the real "Exodus 47". The film ends just after the 
      United Nations vote on 29 November 1947 in Flushing Meadow on the UNSCOP 
      draft for the division of Palestine, paved the way for the foundation of 
      the State of Israel the following May and put an end to the British 
      blockade policy.</P>
      <P class=artx>Prior even to the film's premiere in the USA, there were 
      angry protests by Soviet diplomats over the scene in the film where the 
      results of the vote on the division of Palestine is officially declared. 
      This, despite the fact that the decision regarding the division of 
      Palestine dated back to a 1947 Soviet foreign policy initiative. The scene 
      was filmed in the Russian Compound, a square in Jerusalem which belongs to 
      the Russian Orthodox church and which the Soviet Union had claimed as its 
      property. Through Exodus, the Soviet Union in 1960 was embarrassingly 
      reminded of its former policy, which in the meantime it no longer 
      expoused.</P>
      <P class=artx>Preminger concentrated the action of his film into a three 
      month period. Some of the events which did in fact take place and which 
      are presented in the film actually occured out of the time framework 
      adopted. For example, the bombing of the southern wing of the Kind David 
      Hotel took place on July 22sc 1946 and the spectacular escape of Irgun 
      terrorists from Acco prison on May 4th 1947. The film documents how the 
      flight of Holocaust survivors from Europe translated into the powerful 
      movement for return to Palestine and into the lands' claims of a 
      legitimate national people. While Preminger was shooting the film in 1960, 
      the previous illegal immigration into Palestine, which he filmed as an 
      heroic act of foundation against British Mandate rule, was declared the 
      lawful right of return by the new state. The Exodus, once a return from 
      slavery and presently a return of Holocaust survivors, would from now on 
      determine the Israelis' right to statehood.</P>
      <P class=artx>At the beginning of the film a person is introduced who 
      stands outside the field of action of the other protagonists and who 
      remains throughout the film the only character not to take on a 
      representational historic role. Kitty Fremont (Eva Marie Saint), a 
      non-Jewish American is more or less by chance confronted with the problem 
      of the Jewish displaced persons on Cyprus. In the course of the film she 
      encounters a series of people, or is witness to meetings between people, 
      all of whom are representatives of the conflicting parties involved in the 
      struggle for Israel. Coming across Karen (Jill Haworth), a Jewish girl 
      from Germany, separated from her parents during the Holocaust and now in a 
      detention camp, Kitty believes she can help out by adopting the child and 
      taking her back to the United States. The solution which seems so obvious 
      to the American proves naive and unrealizable. Karen is drawn to Palestine 
      to look for her father, but not only for that reason. Instead of taking 
      Karen back to the United States, Kitty ends up accompanying her to 
      Palestine; she had decided in any case to make herself useful as a nurse 
      on the ship. Through Haganah activist Ari Kanaan (Paul Newman), whose life 
      partner she later becomes, she learns in Cyprus and Palestine about the 
      struggle for Israel. At the end of the film two friends are buried. Karen 
      is shot dead by Arab terrorists, and Tarah, Ari's Arab friend from 
      childhood, is executed on a charge of "collaboration" with Jewish 
      settlers.</P>
      <P class=artx>The two opposing Jewish parties compete for our sympathies: 
      the political realists of the Zionist Haganah, represented by Ari and his 
      father Barak (Lee J. Cobb), and the romantic partisans in the revisionist 
      Irgun Zvai Leumi (Etzel), represented by the young concentration camp 
      survivor Dov Landau (Sal Mineo) and Ari's uncle, Akiva (David Opatoshu). 
      The Zionist political realists determine the outcome of the conflict in 
      their favor, both in the film and in reality. The power of the two 
      conflicting parties was and is secure in the myth that one can build a 
      state with a religion and people, while ignoring all national 
      imponderables. It would have done good to learn from Americans like Kitty 
      how things could have been done better, but Israel consistently refused to 
      take this lesson on board. In its political and economic dependency, 
      Israel is still akin to the 51st state of America; only its intransigence 
      makes it really sovereign.</P>
      <P class=artx>When Mayer Levin filmed <A 
      href="http://www.cine-holocaust.de/cgi-bin/gdq?efw00fbw000301.gd">The 
      Illegals</A> on a genuine immigrant ship, "The Unafraid", between 1947 and 
      1948, the Exodus functionaries appeared as helpers on a dramatic and 
      arduous journey. All the rhetoric which connotated the Exodus was genuine, 
      since the film was largely documentary in concept. In that film it is easy 
      to distinguish between reality and interpretation. There was an Exodus, 
      but first and foremost there was the pure flight of the survivors.</P>
