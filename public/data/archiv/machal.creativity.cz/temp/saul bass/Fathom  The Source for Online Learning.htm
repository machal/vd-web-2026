            1940s, Dana Andrews (1909-92) became famous as a leading man in such 
            Hollywood films as <I>The Ox-Bow Incident</I> (1943), <I>Laura</I> 
            (1944) and <I>The Best Years of Our Lives</I> (1946). His career 
            continued during the '50s with <I>My Foolish Heart</I> (1950), 
            <I>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</I> (1956) and <I>While the City 
            Sleeps</I> (1956). In this 1958 interview with the Columbia 
            University Oral History Research Office, Andrews talks about making 
            Westerns and working with director Otto 
        Preminger.</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

                  Arizona, making <I>The Westerner</I> that I got a call from my 
                  agent, and he said that Goldwyn was thinking of selling half 
                  of my contract--or sharing it--with 20th Century Fox, and what 
                  did I think about it. I don't know how much I really had to 
                  say about it; I think it was his prerogative, not mine. But it 
                  seemed like a good thing to me, and as it turned out it was a 
                  very good thing, because of the sit-down strike of Mr. 
                  Goldwyn. Actually, the sit-down strike happened after <I>The 
                  Westerner</I>. He held <I>The Westerner</I> for a year because 
                  of it and wouldn't release it. In my opinion, one of the best 
                  pictures I've ever made was a Western, called <I>The Ox-Bow 
                  Incident</I>. That's one of the classic 
              Westerns.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

                  my misfortunate has been, in some cases, to be in just another 
                  Western, which they don't publicize, really. Some of the 
                  Westerns I made were good. Another one I made, which you would 
                  call an outdoor picture, was up in Oregon, <I>Gold Canyon

                  played detective stories, and I've played lawyers. During the 
                  war, I was in every branch of the service, I think--I played 
                  everything but a general. Mr. Skouras, the head of 20th 
                  Century Fox, chairman of the board, once told me this, after 
                  it had happened. The picture that made me what is called a 
                  star, he told me once at his house in Mamaroneck, was <I>The 
                  Purple Heart</I>.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

                  face="times newroman,serif" size=3>Well, this was rather 
                  surprising to me. I knew it was a pretty good picture, but it 
                  was a war picture and very similar in some respects to <I>30 
                  Seconds Over Tokyo</I>, and so didn't receive great national 
                  acclaim in <I>Life</I> magazine or something. The reason for 
                  that was that the part I played in this was a captain in 
                  charge of a whole group of men, and it was a very kindly 
                  treated character. The women all over the country, whose men 
                  were away at war, identified their husbands as being that sort 
                  of a man. For some reason, this made a terrific impression on 
                  them. There was no romance in it at all. There was not even a 
                  woman in it. There was a very short little flashback, I think 
                  about 30 seconds, of my being back home. But this was the 
                  picture that he said put me over.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

                  an appearance with <I>Woodrow Wilson</I>. I was not in 
                  <I>Woodrow Wilson</I>, but studio personnel would be sent

                  picture, and George Jessel and various people under contract 
                  at 20th Century Fox. When I was introduced on the stage at 
                  Philadelphia, there was quite an ovation--people stamping 
                  their feet and whistling and screaming little girls and so 
                  on--and George Jessel, who was introducing me, looked at me

                  Preminger; it was started by Rouben Mamoulian. This is the 
                  second time this has happened. Since this is not for 
                  publication, I think it's a very interesting little sidelight, 
                  because this happened to me and it's one of the things that I 
                  know for sure and not hearsay. I have great admiration for Mr. 
                  Preminger, but this is a true incident. Mr. Preminger was the 
                  producer of this picture, and Mr. Mamoulian was the director. 
                  I think Mr. Preminger wanted to be a producer-director. (This 
                  is my own opinion, that he wanted to.) In any case, he became 
                  one on this picture. I talked to Mr. Preminger and Mr. 
                  Mamoulian for some time about the character, and they wanted 
                  to do this in a different way. What conversations they'd had 
                  between themselves, I don't know, but they were in agreement 
                  in talking to me that they wanted this character played as 
                  though he were a student of criminology from Yale or Harvard 
                  or something like that, and not at all the hard-boiled 
                  detective that you generally see. But this was something that 
                  I think Mr. Preminger wanted to be different, in this 
                  respect--to blaze a trail. This was very interesting to me, 
                  too. I didn't know how it would come out, but I knew what they 
                  meant and, having been a college man, I had some idea of how 
                  college men conducted themselves.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

                  Mr. Zanuck, who was out of town, came back into town, and a 
                  great commotion was heard. He saw the rushes of what had been

                  The next morning, Mr. Mamoulian was out, and Mr. Preminger was 
                  the producer-director of the picture. A very curious little 
                  thing, this. Of course it upset everybody in the picture, 
                  because we were very fond of Rouben. He's a very fine 
                  gentleman. We were really upset. As a matter of fact, I think 
                  the whole cast, including the principals, got together and 
                  bemoaned the fact that he was taken off the picture, and 
                  didn't quite understand why. Judith Anderson practically 
                  refused to act. She made her appearance, technically, but 
                  wouldn't take Mr. Preminger's direction. He said, "Miss 
                  Anderson, you know that you're capable of ..." She'd answer, 
                  "I just don't see it that way," or something like that. This 
                  of course was rather childish, but it was her way of rebelling 
                  at the change that had come about. But she got over this very 
                  quickly, and in a couple of days he had everyone won over. 
                  This was designing and it was ambitious; but he did a

                  face="times newroman,serif" size=3>So I told him I just didn't 
                  understand. He said, "Well, what do you want to do?" I said, 
                  "I see it this way ..." It was patched up. Since then, with 
                  the success of <I>Laura</I>, Mr. Preminger got me into three 
                  pictures, none of which I wanted to do. One was <I>Daisy 
                  Kenyon</I>, another was <I>Fallen Angel</I>, which I was very 
                  adamant about and practically took a suspension over, and only 
                  on the advice of my lawyer and my agent did I finally do the 
                  picture, because I thought it was pretty bad. It was bad. It 
                  put Alice Faye out of business completely. That's her last 
                  picture. I had long conversations with her, and I found out 
                  later why there was pressure for me to do the picture: it was 
                  because Alice, who had been semi-retired, said unless she 
                  found something she wanted to do she wouldn't do it. Well, 
                  Alice was a big box-office draw for 20th Century Fox, and they 
                  didn't want her idle. So they sent her every script that came 
                  in, practically, hoping she'd find something interesting she 
                  might like to do. Well, this little story came along. She had 
                  seen <I>Laura</I>, and she liked me in this part. It was a 
                  good part--almost anybody could have done it. She said, "I'll 
                  do this one if you can get Dana Andrews." This I didn't know. 
                  So this is why it happened.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

                  me, I said no. Otto called me in. I had a number of 
                  conversations with him. He didn't understand why I didn't like 
                  it. I said, "In the first place, I don't think it's a picture 
                  for Alice Faye, but besides that, I don't like the part for 
                  me. I don't like the picture. It's terrible. It's in bad 
                  taste, it's unbelievable. I just can't see it at

                  where they were going to put me on suspension if I didn't do 
                  it, and my agent said, "You won't work for a year, probably, 
                  or six months anyway. It can't be that bad. With Alice Faye 
                  they'll give it a big ballyhoo."</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

                  out--situations change--they didn't give it a big ballyhoo, 
                  and it just fell. There were long conversations I had with 
                  Miss Faye, when I said, "Why did you ever do this?" "Oh, you 
                  wait and see, this is going to be great, it's terrific." As it 
                  turned out, Linda Darnell was the best thing in the picture, 
                  and the scene I had with her was the only good thing in the 
                  picture--at least it was showy.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
