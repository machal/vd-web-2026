      <P>Otto Preminger was born in 1905 (not 1906, as usually reported), the 
      son of a prosecutor for the Austrian Empire. Otto studied law but wanted 
      to become an actor, and at 17 joined the company of Max Reinhardt. He rose 
      quickly to director, was chosen to take over Reinhardt's theater on the 
      latter's retirement, and was offered, at age 27, the post of the head of 
      the State Theatre in Vienna. He turned it down on learning that a 
      condition of assuming the post was conversion to Catholicism (the 
      Premingers were Jewish, although Otto was not religious).</P>
      <P>Preminger's theater successes came to the attention of film and theater 
      producers in America, and in 1936, he arrived in Hollywood to direct for 
      20th Century-Fox. His Hollywood career floundered until, in 1944, he was 
      assigned to produce and, eventually, direct the film version of Vera 
      Caspary's mystery novel <I>Laura</I>. The result was a hit that solidified 
      Preminger's reputation and has endured as a classic.</P>

        Ends</FONT></I></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>While under contract to 20th Century-Fox, Preminger directed several 
      thrillers that elaborated on the spell of <I>Laura</I>: <I>Fallen 
      Angel</I> (1945), <I>Whirlpool</I> (1949), <I>Where the Sidewalk Ends</I> 
      (1950), <I>The 13th Letter</I> (1951), and (on loan to RKO) <I>Angel 
      Face</I> (1952). This group of films - to which may be added the Joan 
      Crawford soap opera <I>Daisy Kenyon</I> (1947) - remains, for some 
      viewers, the core of the Preminger canon: black-and-white films with 
      ambiguous narratives foregrounding male obsession and female perversity, 
      marked by fluid camera movements and the presence of iconic actors such as 
      Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney.</P>
      <P>Preminger launched his career as an independent producer-director with 
      the comedy <I>The Moon Is Blue</I> (1953), released without the Production 
      Code's Seal of Approval (withheld on the grounds of supposedly risqué 
      dialogue, including the word "virgin"). He flouted Hollywood censorship 
      again by filming <I>The Man with the Golden Arm</I> (1955), Nelson 
      Algren's novel about a heroin addict.</P>
      <P>After <I>Anatomy of a Murder</I> (1959), which remains, with 
      <I>Laura</I>, Preminger's most popular film, he made a series of long, 
      sweeping, all-star blockbusters based on popular novels on 
      social-political themes: <I>Exodus</I> (1960), <I>Advise and Consent</I> 
      (1962), <I>The Cardinal</I> (1963), <I>In Harm's Way</I> (1965), <I>Hurry 
      Sundown</I> (1966). <A name=b1></A>Though these films were noted for their 
      location shooting and other hallmarks of realism, they met with decreasing 
      respect from critics. One factor in the critical disapproval of Preminger 
      was his public image: notorious for his tyranny on the set, Preminger 
      cultivated his celebrity and became, along with Hitchcock, one of the only 
      Hollywood directors to be widely familiar to the general public.</P>
      <P>It would be easy to say that Preminger was <I>also</I> an artist, but 
      this is not precisely what needs to be said. "His enemies have never 
      forgiven him for being a director with the personality of a producer," 
      Andrew Sarris wrote. <A 
      href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/preminger.html#1">(1)</A> 
      Preminger presents himself through his works as someone essentially 
      detached, impersonal, and objective. In his impassive long takes, 
      different ideologies and points of view battle for dominance; his films 
      emphasise pragmatism but gravitate toward irony, doubt, and enigma. The 
      audience leaves <I>Exodus</I>, as Gary Indiana wrote, less certain about 
      the issues surrounding the formation of the state of Israel than when it 
      went in. <A 
      href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/preminger.html#2">(2)</A></P>
      <P>To the critics of <I>Cahiers du cinéma</I>, Preminger was almost a 
      mystical figure. In 1954, <I>Angel Face</I> and <I>The Moon Is Blue</I> 
      moved Jacques Rivette to ask "What is <I>mise en scène</I>?" and to give 
      this definition, which sums up what attracted the more intellectual French 
      cineastes to American cinema: "the creation of a precise complex of sets 
      and characters, a network of relationships, an architecture of 
      connections, an animated complex that seems suspended in space." <A 
      href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/preminger.html#3">(3)</A></P>

      <P>Preminger represents the height of the kind of cinema Rivette defines 
      here (which might be called "classical"): one in which bodies, movements, 
      spaces, gestures, and dialogue are contained within an ever-changing 
      unity, the transcendental comprehension of which is both the task of the 
      work and an elusive promise held out by the medium. Crucial to this 
      conception of cinema is the camera's power to link characters and place. 
      In Preminger's films (as in Nicholas Ray's), shots of the exteriors of 
      buildings, of people entering rooms, etc., are not merely "establishing" 
      shots, preludes whose content is equivalent to their function; rather, 
      such shots are central to a main purpose of the films - to find a visual 
      correlative for the freedom of people to determine their own destinies. 
      Already clear in <I>Laura</I>, <I>Fallen Angel</I>, and <I>Daisy 
      Kenyon</I>, this drive becomes dominant in <I>Exodus</I> and <I>Advise and 
      Consent</I>, which follow the coming-together and splitting-apart of large 
      casts of characters through a dazzling range of tonalities and 
      settings.</P>
      <P><A name=b4></A>Preminger defines his characters in terms of the social 
      and institutional structures that protect them and that sometimes conceal 
      them. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews), the detective hero of <I>Laura</I>, 
      makes his crucial assertion of individuality - his admission that he is in 
      love with Laura (Gene Tierney) - through a paradoxical and revealing 
      retreat to the impersonality of procedure, when he takes her to 
      headquarters for questioning. His admission - "It was getting so I felt I 
      needed official surroundings" - could be the motto for other Preminger 
      heroes, such as Fermoyle (Tom Tryon) in <I>The Cardinal</I>.</P>
      <P>Preminger's concern with the contrasting discourses and gestures 
      possible within a given structure makes his films a privileged terrain for 
      the study of what Mikhail Bakhtin calls "speech genres." <A 
      href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/preminger.html#4">(4)</A> 
      Throughout <I>Advise and Consent</I>, perhaps his richest film from this 
      point of view, Preminger explores situations in which characters switch 
      from one speech mode to another, depending on who else is present. And one 
      of the film's central themes is expressed in the concept of the 
      "Washington, D.C. lie": a statement uttered in the tacit understanding 
      that the addressee not only knows it to be false, but also knows that the 
      sender knows that the addressee knows it to be false.</P>

        Murder</FONT></I></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P><I>Anatomy of a Murder</I> presents a somewhat similar duality: on the 
      one hand, the official transcript of the trial excludes outbursts by the 
      lawyers and improper testimony, but on the other hand, as the attorneys 
      are aware, the jury hears and understands everything. The film itself 
      becomes a trial - not only in the sense that the film's viewers are 
      invited to come to their own decisions about the truth of what is said, 
      but in that every utterance takes up a definite position with respect to 
      what has previously been uttered.</P>
      <P>Some of the most haunting scenes in Preminger films are those in which 
      dialogue ceases, multivoicedness dies down, and a character is left to 
      confront his or her own enigma in silence: e.g., McPherson in Laura's 
      apartment; Dan (Dana Andrews) with the milk bottle in <I>Daisy Kenyon</I>; 
      Diana (Jean Simmons) waiting for Frank (Robert Mitchum) in the empty house 
      in <I>Angel Face</I>; the brief solitudes of Cécile (Jean Seberg) in 
      <I>Bonjour Tristesse</I> (1958); Brig (Don Murray) returning to his office 
      to commit suicide in <I>Advise and Consent</I>; Fermoyle in his room in 
      Vienna in <I>The Cardinal</I>; Henry (Michael Caine) alone in his house in 
      <I>Hurry Sundown</I>. In such scenes, Preminger emphasises the terror and 
      loneliness of the secret emptinesses that surround the fora where dialogue 
      and understanding take place.</P>
      <P>The primary appeal to Reason made by every Preminger film thus 
      acknowledges, in a second movement, its own provenance in the irrational 
      to which, in a third, it returns. Reason is a fiction that is constructed 
      to explain the inexplicable events of the narrative (<I>Bunny Lake Is 
      Missing</I> [1965] is the ultimate demonstration of this process).</P>
      <P>The end of a Preminger shot often has a hallucinatory, fantastic power, 
      as if the scene, suddenly vacated by the narrative, were exposed to the 
      threat - constantly present in Preminger - of the insignificant (cf. the 
      smashed clock at the end of <I>Laura</I> and the camera peering down at a 
      garbage can at the end of <I>Anatomy of a Murder</I>). At the end of the 
      dance-hall sequence in <I>Carmen Jones</I> (1954), after Carmen (Dorothy 
      Dandridge) and Joe (Harry Belafonte) have gone offscreen, the camera stays 
      on the front of the house, through the curtained windows of which we see 
      people dancing inside. Or, at the end of the party scene in <I>Advise and 
      Consent</I>, Van Ackerman (George Grizzard) approaches the camera and 
      beckons to his offscreen driver as the shot dissolves. The entire final 
      section of <I>Angel Face</I> is a terrifying descent into nothingness. The 
      threat of such a collapse haunts <I>Bonjour Tristesse,</I> with its 
      repeated dissolves between color past and black-and-white present.</P>
      <P>Throughout <I>In Harm's Way</I>, images assault each other rather than 
      complement each other or succeed each other logically. The narrative 
      principle of the film is, simply, the driving away of one image by the 
      next. The pure abstract expression of this principle is the stunning end 
      credits, in which shots of waves chase each other off the screen with 
      increasing violence, giving way to shots of explosions that grow in 
      intensity and scope (culminating in the atomic), and finally to a shot of 
      the earth seen from outer space - the last position of the consciousness 
      that takes indifferent account of the random human activity charted by the 
      film.</P>

      <P>The tremendous fluidity of Preminger's films is nowhere more a 
      celebration of nothingness than in <I>In Harm's Way</I>. Preminger gives a 
      definition of what's left after all the actions in the narrative have 
      cancelled each other out: the negative ecstasy of the film's completely 
      hostile and inexplicable landscape in which we, along with the film's 
      characters, are lost. The film's cast of stars of the past, present, and 
      future is a fragmented and dispersed body that stands in for ours and that 
      experiences, in our place, terrible destruction.</P>
      <P>Barthes, cited by Rivette: "there is a text from the moment one can 
      say: things are circulating." <A 
      href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/preminger.html#5">(5)</A> 
      In <I>In Harm's Way</I> and <I>Hurry Sundown</I>, this moment is somewhat 
      imprecise. One watches the film and has to be carried along with it for a 
      while before the issues at stake sort themselves out. The people, places, 
      things on screen are clear (in the "monumental" way Rivette describes: 
      "closed in on themselves, turned inward, exactly as a statue can be, 
      presenting themselves without immediately stating an identity"), <A 
      href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/preminger.html#6">(6)</A> 
      but what we are to make of them is not. Hence the illusion, which 
      Preminger cultivates in film after film (<I>Bonjour Tristesse</I>, 
      <I>Advise and Consent</I>, <I>Such Good Friends</I> [1971]), of a 
      first-order reality into which the viewer is thrust without introductions, 
      and with whose objects and rules one gradually makes acquaintance without 
      ever penetrating into their soul. But the euphoria of weightlessness thus 
      instilled is merely a deception that permits Preminger to fulfill what 
      Rivette sees as the role of the cinema: "to take people out of their 
      cocoons and plunge them into horror." <A 
      href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/preminger.html#7">(7)</A> 
      </P>
      <P><I>Hurry Sundown</I> is the pivotal film in what some have seen as a 
      vulgarisation of style and hystericisation of content in Preminger's late 
      period. His next film, <I>Skidoo</I> (1968), was reviled by most reviewers 
      as the director's pathetically foolish and heavy-handed attempt to get 
      "with it." Viewed unencumbered by the prejudices of its time, the film 
      looks visionary. The generation-gap farce of <I>Skidoo</I> makes both the 
      old and the young seem absurd and reprehensible, but it also preserves 
      them and uplifts them beyond good and evil; in <I>Skidoo</I> Preminger is 
      not trying to be with it - he is with it <I>a priori</I> because of the 
      match-up between his own negativity and that of the time and the scene he 
      documents. What seemed to contemporary reviewers a disintegration of 
      Preminger's style and a loss of his control is an intentional effort to 
      smash the frame, comparable to certain devices in Godard's films of the 
      same period, although because Preminger remained a mainstream, 
      establishment filmmaker, in his work this anti-cinema impulse appeared, to 
      some, tainted with corruption and opportunism.</P>

          <TD width=19>&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
      <P>Preminger's late films show the resurgence of a characteristic present 
      in a hard-to-classify cycle from the middle of Preminger's Golden Age: 
      <I>Angel Face</I>, <I>The Moon Is Blue</I>, <I>River of No Return</I> 
      (1954), and <I>Carmen Jones</I>. In these films, the condition of 
      Preminger's noted "objectivity" is that the world he is describing is 
      totally artificial. The beginning of <I>The Moon Is Blue</I> - in which 
      what we take at first to be the Manhattan skyline turns out to be a 
      diorama in a window - seals off this world in the most direct and 
      arbitrary way, and at an almost explicit level of fantasy, as if the film 
      were intended to demonstrate the moral and psychological consequences of 
      an original misrecognition. The extent to which Preminger's long takes 
      insist on closure, on the subordination of all elements to the limits of 
      time and place, is remarkable for the classical Hollywood cinema, which is 
      usually only "realist" within a small area bounded by a larger area that 
      is purely fantastic. In <I>River of No Return</I> (a film whose stylistic 
      motto might be: never do in two shots what can be done in one), 
      CinemaScope becomes an enclosure and a measure of the characters, with an 
      arbitrariness that takes us far from tragedy and also far from irony.</P>
      <P>With <I>Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon</I> (1970), Preminger 
      turns himself, and the cinema, inside out. <I>Exodus</I>, <I>Advise and 
      Consent</I>, <I>The Cardinal</I>, and <I>In Harm's Way</I> examine the 
      possibilities for conscience, freedom, and poetry within the vast spaces 
      of history, mega-institutions, and Panavision. In <I>Junie Moon</I>, we 
      seem to witness the collapsing of the great, impersonal Premingerian point 
      of view, as if the wrong end of a telescope were being held to the eye. If 
      Preminger's blockbusters seek to show power without succumbing to it, to 
      show power in its death, <I>Junie Moon</I> is the pathetic revenge of the 
      powerless, Preminger's atonement for having been too fascinated with the 
      cinema as power.</P>
      <P>This renunciation of power affects the cinematic sign. Preminger's 
      tendency toward the banalisation of the image - a tendency that accounts 
      for a large part of the mystique of <I>River of No Return</I> and 
      <I>Carmen Jones</I> - is magnified in <I>Junie Moon </I>by the eruption of 
      the zoom, which seems to signal a general devaluation of the image as 
      such: on the one hand, there's a suspicion of the image's seductive power 
      and an insistence on marring it, making it impossible for the non-perverse 
      viewer to fall in love with the image; on the other hand, the image is 
      reduced to a convenient milieu, lacking intrinsic compositional interest 
      and making no claim to grace or order, for characters who loosely redefine 
      its limits as they move.</P>
      <P><I>Junie Moon</I> is two films: one, a film that criticises the power 
      of the sign by dwelling on the sign's proximity to death, and that 
      therefore can be assigned a relation to the main currents of Preminger's 
      work (it is noteworthy, for example, that both it and <I>Exodus</I> end 
      with characters leaving a funeral, and that both endings explicitly 
      renounce closure, gathering up and amplifying the reverberations of the 
      deaths in question). Two, a film that places itself, or wants to, beyond 
      the power or even the powerlessness of the sign, beyond powers and signs 
      to work on the audience, in spite of the audience, as pure affect - as 
      pure love, to take the title at its word, and the telling of it: a telling 
      that grabs the viewer as it lets him/her go, a telling that works to 
      liberate the hearer, that allows him to die.</P>
      <P><I><A name=b8></A>Such Good Friends</I> continues Preminger's stylistic 
      divergence from his pre-<I>Skidoo</I> work, only to reach an updated 
      version of the reserve and ambiguity of the '40s melodramas. Like 
      Preminger's great films, <I>Such Good Friends</I> accepts the moral 
      weakness of people and the inaccessibility of their motives, while seeking 
      to trace, through their behavior and beliefs, eternity at work changing 
      them into the forms they assume. The final disappearance of the heroine 
      (Dyan Cannon) into Central Park recalls the enigmatically open ending of 
      <I>Bonjour Tristesse</I>: a point from which no advance is indicated, but 
      which could lead to anything.</P>
      <P>The final movement in Preminger's work is the most hopeless: in 
      <I>Rosebud</I> (1975), the professionalism of the hero, secret agent 
      Martin (Peter O'Toole), is a cynical adjustment to what Jean Baudrillard 
      called a permanent "transpolitical" situation ("end of the scene of 
      history… equilibrium of terror and dissuasion…."). <A 
      href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/preminger.html#8">(8)</A> 
      <I>Rosebud</I> is the emptiest of Preminger's films; its world is 
      unconvincing from top to bottom, completing the progression marked by 
      <I>Skidoo</I>, <I>Junie Moon</I>, and <I>Such Good Friends</I> - three 
      films in which realism is no longer the point because for Preminger, it's 
      the world that has become unreal. Finally, <I>The Human Factor</I> (1979), 
      that most humane of last testaments, is a sorrowful portrait of 
      <I>détente</I>. The hero, Castle (Nicol Williamson), is the ultimate 
      Premingerian sophisticate: a double agent whose fate is to embody, and to 
      pay the ultimate stakes in, a historical struggle that has become 
      theoretical.</P>
      <P>Preminger is an increasingly attractive figure. He represents the 
      beauty, arrogance, and mystique of classical American cinema and embodies 
      its highest values of craftsmanship and respect for the audience. He also 
      represents - at a high level of formal complexity - a configuration of 
      power, the visual, and loss that still defines cinematic seduction.</P>
