size=+3>H</FONT>ollywood filmmaking reached its aesthetic apex in the 50s. 
Though many directors used the studios' vast resources merely to tell stories, 
auteurs were breaking new ground with their use of composition, camera movement, 
and editing, presenting their narratives clearly enough to meet the demands of 
the mass audience yet artfully enough to be almost abstract works of moving 
light. 
<P><A href="http://www.eonline.com/Facts/People/0,12,12700,00.html">Otto 
Preminger</A>'s 1958 <I>Bonjour Tristesse</I> — one of the masterworks of the 
period — used the relatively new format of <A 
href="http://www.simplecom.net/widefilm/widescreen/cinemascoperef.htm">CinemaScope</A> 
to present its five characters in various tableaux. <A 
href="http://www.comp.brad.ac.uk/research/GIP/cinemascope.html">CinemaScope</A> 
was often used with subjects almost absurdly well suited to the screen's shape: 
one of the first such pictures was a submarine movie. But Preminger uses it in 
this film to depict ambiguous, shifting relationships in a tale of conflicting 
obsessions. Unavailable in its original form for decades, the film has recently 
been restored and is being shown here once, on Thursday, September 30, at the <A 
href="http://www.artic.edu/webspaces/siskelfilmcenter/">Film Center</A>. 
<P>Following fairly closely the <A 
href="http://www.globenet.org/chroniqueur/00/rubriques/entretien_cinema.html">Françoise 
Sagan</A> novel on which it's based, the film's principal action occurs in 
summer in and around a villa on the French Riviera rented by wealthy playboy 
Raymond (David Niven) for himself, his teenage daughter Cecile (Jean Seberg), 
and his current mistress, Elsa (Mylene Demongeot). The father and daughter are 
quite close, but the film avoids suggesting incestuous desires, as does the 
book: Raymond and Cecile are bonded by their shared enjoyment of laughter and 
silliness, partying, and gentle relaxing (one morning they "smell the day" 
together). Cecile has become accustomed to Raymond's steady stream of much 
younger mistresses, but then a longtime family friend of about his age, 
accomplished fashion designer Anne Larsen (Deborah Kerr), joins them at the 
villa. Elsa, feeling abandoned, departs with an admirer named Pablo, 
and&nbsp;<T-2>Raymond and Anne become a couple and announce their plans to 
marry. Unfortunately for Cecile, the serious Anne wants her to study for a 
philosophy exam (instead she does yoga — "Hindu philosophy" — in her room) and 
bans her from further contact with her boyfriend, Philippe (Geoffrey Horne). 
Sensing that her years of happiness with her father may be ending, Cecile 
hatches an ultimately disastrous plan: she convinces Philippe and Elsa to pose 
as lovers, hoping to goad Raymond into trying to win Elsa back from the much 
younger Philippe.<T0> 
<P>The novel, narrated by Cecile, is a social drama about a girl drawn to 
superficial pleasures both because of her age and her father's example. While 
some of Sagan's portrait survives in the film, Seberg too often recites lines 
rather than inhabiting her role, and Niven's air of uninformed superficiality 
seems more English than French. Like Sagan — who has Cecile tell the story 
almost a year after it happened — Preminger begins and ends the film with Cecile 
filmed in black and white in Paris reflecting in voice-over on her isolation and 
sadness. By framing color scenes — and on occasion interrupting them — with 
black-and-white scenes of the present, Preminger makes the world of the seaside 
story seem more sensual and intense but also impermanent.<T-2> 
<P>Intercutting color with black-and-white footage is an obvious stylistic 
device, and on the whole Preminger's style here is relatively transparent, 
especially compared with such contemporaneous masterworks as Hitchcock's <I><A 
href="http://www.fredcamper.com/Film/Hitchcock.html">Vertigo</A></I> and 
Welles'<T0>s <I><A 
href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/1998/0998/09188.html">Touch 
of Evil</A></I>. Preminger's camera follows the actions of his characters; only 
rarely does the camerawork seem self-conscious. But the film does establish a 
dreamy continuity from one seaside scene to another, a spell at once broken and 
enhanced by these scenes' juxtaposition with the gray, bleak present. 
<CENTER>
<P>***</CENTER>
<P>Preminger's style is subtle and restrained. But as in most great narrative 
films, the camera here in effect reinvents the story, transforming Sagan's 
first-person character study into a melancholy dance of personalities at utter 
cross-purposes. These conflicts are inherent in the narrative: it's obvious that 
Raymond will fail to match Anne's seriousness, just as Cecile fails to match 
Philippe's commitment to her, yet Cecile and Raymond show a greater 
self-awareness than Elsa. But what Preminger does is translate the shifting 
relationships between these very different personalities into carefully 
choreographed camera movements, which over time evolve into an intensely 
expressive vision of ever-changing, ever expanding space. 
<P>Most of the film is made up of relatively long tableaulike takes, yet 
Preminger often transforms static shots of conversations when a character leaves 
the group. Following one character out of a scene had been a common device in 
Hollywood filmmaking for decades, but Preminger uses it with such systematic 
care — often without cutting — that it comes to represent this world's 
underlying instability. When a group breaks up, his camera follows their bodies, 
twisting first one way, then another. Eventually the viewer sees every static 
composition as founded on shifting sand — a momentary configuration of 
relationships and emotions that's bound to change. This approach makes even the 
affectionate father-daughter bond seem strangely impermanent — though of course 
the film's flashbacks also reveal that their relationship has weakened. The 
camera alone allows us to see that Anne's self-assurance will be no match for 
Raymond's and Cecile's flighty emotions, not so much because of the kind of 
people they are as because their sensual, sun-drenched world — represented by 
the ever present, impossibly blue sea and seen through Preminger's profoundly 
ungrounded camera — is ultimately opposed to monogamous affections. Raymond and 
Cecile's bond survives only because each allows the other multiple romantic 
partners. 
<P>Fragmentation occurs in various ways in the film's key scenes. When Raymond 
tells a lie to conceal his planned meeting with Elsa, he's one of three people 
shown at lunch, but he soon wanders off into the background. When Cecile has 
second thoughts and contemplates ending her scheme, she stands against a wall to 
the right in a geometric image that shows Anne seated in a window to the left, 
then suddenly rising and going outside, where she appears on Cecile's right and 
moves into the foreground and then walks away. Just before Raymond and Cecile 
see Philippe and Elsa lying together literally at their feet, they take a 
twisting path through the woods, which the camera records in a diverse mix of 
movements and positions, finally filming them from slightly above. Eventually 
one starts to notice small asymmetries even in the static shots — a slight high 
angle here, a slight obliqueness there. These perspectives open up a gap between 
the camera and the characters, implying that the composition we see is only a 
momentary arrangement of bodies in a wider, freer space. Dancing together, the 
camera and characters trace the lineaments of both fickleness and obsession, of 
passing fancies and their dark consequences. 
<P>Ultimately the film's space — the mental construct created by the composition 
of images over time — has two poles. Tight and entrapping images consistently 
open up, suggesting a dialogue between imprisonment and freedom — an idea also 
central to Cecile's effort to recover her carefree life. At the same time the 
twisting camera movements and oblique angles combine with the ever present sea 
to suggest a vaster universe than anything visible in a single composition. The 
malleability of most of the images indicates the characters' freedom to wander 
off. Yet the many different directions they take suggest that their freedom 
leads to chaos and fragmentation, each locked in a separate world, none in true 
contact with the others. <BR>
<CENTER>
<P>***</CENTER>
<P><T-2>Preminger further undermines his romantic idyll, turning it into a near 
fantasy, with the framing sequences in black and white. These are printed on 
color stock, so that the grays and blacks are not the absolute tones produced by 
silver but the more tentative ones produced by color dyes. This also links the 
black-and-white and color sections, making the gray Paris scenes seem like 
variations on or consequences of the sunlight-saturated ones, drained of color 
by the cold reality Cecile and Raymond have tried so hard to avoid. 
<P><T0>The idea that compositions, camera movements, and printing 
black-and-white images on color stock can be used to critique a story is the 
product of the classical period of Hollywood filmmaking. That ethos seems remote 
now, when one of our richest directors, known for his sci-fi epics, has said 
that the really "fun" part of filmmaking is not directing but designing the 
fantasy characters and toys. Preminger, by contrast, saw his films as structural 
wholes; he even brought a lawsuit once when a television station interrupted one 
of his films with commercials. Moreover, the structure of a film like <I>Bonjour 
Tristesse </I>is the product of an underlying morality — as are the structures 
of many masterpieces of that period: the characters' actions are judged not only 
by their consequences but by the camera's eye. 
<P>Preminger chooses to end <I>Bonjour Tristesse</I> — a film with few 
close-ups, whose group shots reveal the enchantments and delusions of mostly 
"silly" people — with his closest shot yet. We see a saddened Cecile in a mirror 
applying cold cream to her face while contemplating in voice-over the wall that 
her failed plotting has erected around her — thoughts affectingly rendered by 
the empty space of the 'Scope frame surrounding her head. This anomalous 
close-up provides the film's final moment of horror: Cecile's isolation helps us 
realize that schemes based solely on one's own emotional needs, even when 
designed to bind you closer to another, will leave you utterly alone in the end.
